# Cumulative XType Extension

## Description
The *Cumulative XType* extension is a WeeWX extension that installs an XType that provides cumulative series data with a flexible user settable reset date-time. When used with the WeeWX image generator this enables the generation of cumulative plots that reset at a specified time or date and time. For example, a cumulative rain plot can be produced for a day with the rainfall resetting to zero at midnight or a cumulative rain plot can be produced for a week with the rainfall resetting to zero at 9am daily.

The extension consists of a single WeeWX XType and an associated WeeWX service. A single config option *reset* is supported that allows the user to specify the date-time conditions that reset the cumulative data.

## Pre-requisites
The *Cumulative XType* extension requires WeeWX v4.0.0 or greater and will operate under Python 2 or Python 3.
